## **About Me**

Hello! I'm **Durga Prasad**, a passionate developer specializing in building comprehensive **full-stack applications**. I'm currently an undergraduate student at RVR and JC College of Engineering, with a strong focus on creating efficient, scalable, and elegant software solutions. My work is built on a foundation of clean code, problem-solving, and a commitment to continuous learning.

My expertise bridges the gap between front-end and back-end development. I enjoy crafting intuitive user interfaces with **React.js** and engineering robust, high-performance systems using **Spring Boot 3** and **Node.js**.

Beyond traditional web development, I have a deep interest in **AI and Machine Learning**. I've applied my skills in this area to solve data-driven challenges, leveraging powerful libraries like **NumPy**, **Pandas**, and **scikit-learn**. My background in **Data Structures and Algorithms** ensures that every solution I build is not only functional but also optimized for performance.
